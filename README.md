## Abstract

_In a world of complex and sophisticated flavors, the battle for toppings among the ice cream families is raging in Web-steros! Who knows who will win between the crunchies of the Angular castle, the hot fudge of the React lands, or the sprinkles of the Vue islands?!_

_During this time, in another place, the independent Vanilla walks towards his destiny. Could he be the hero from the legend, whom could turn things around?_

_Hear my story, traveler! My old eyes have seen him in these lands! Let me tell you how he helped us taking down our old king, and you shall learn how he could help you too..._
