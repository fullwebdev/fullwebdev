_The Web platform is constantly evolving...and it's been 4 years now that we are still talking about the same 4 technologies for the 4 key elements that make a great web app: Fast, Integrated, Reliable & Engaging._

_It's time to get up to speed!_

_Let's take a few minutes to:_

1. _take stock of the latest W3C, WICG and WHATWG drafts_
1. _demonstrate each of them in the browser_
1. _present concrete applications and what each brings to our users_
1. _explore a global methodology to always transition smoothly_

_So, are you ready for the future of the web?_
