## About

FIRE stand for **F**ast, **I**ntegrated, **R**eliable & **E**ngaging.
Those are the four pillars of UX, DX (Developer eXperience) & quality everyone should care about when creating Web Apps.

Advocating for their adoption (an thus Web Developers) is one of my main focuses since 2018.

This monorepo host a lot of things! Go check the following chapters for more details.

> :information_source: I'm currently in the process of migrating all my related projects to this monorepo.
> In the meantime, most of them are provided as submodules.
