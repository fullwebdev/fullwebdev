> The F.I.R.E. safety kit for everyone!\
> Learn the best new capabilities of the modern web in one shot without burning out!

::: details
The Web platform is constantly evolving...and it's been 4 years now that we are still talking about the same 4 technologies for the 4 key elements that make a great web app: Fast, Integrated, Reliable & Engaging.

It's time to get up to speed!

Let's take a few minutes to:

- take stock of the latest W3C, WICG and WHATWG drafts
- demonstrate each of them in the browser
- present concrete applications and what each brings to our users
- explore a global methodology to always transition smoothly

So, are you ready for the future of the web?

In a world of complex and sophisticated flavors, the battle for toppings among the ice cream families is raging in Web-steros! Who knows who will win between the crunchies of the Angular castle, the hot fudge of the React lands, or the sprinkles of the Vue islands?!

During this time, in another place, the independent Vanilla walks towards his destiny. Could he be the hero from the legend, whom could turn things around?

Hear my story, traveler! My old eyes have seen him in these lands! Let me tell you how he helped us taking down our old king, and you shall learn how he could help you too...

## Web on FIRE (v1.0)

**The Web is on FIRE!**

> The F.I.R.E. safety kit for everyone!\
> Learn the best new capabilities of the modern web in one shot without burning out!

::: details
Four years ago the idea of Progressive Web Apps arrived in the world. This brought a whole new approach to mobile & web apps development, often summarized as F.I.R.E. (Fast Integrated Reliable & Engaging). But the web platform is constantly evolving and mutating, so how has F.I.R.E. technology evolved with it?

Join me to explore four cutting-edge technologies (one for each F.I.R.E. concept) that will help bring your web apps to the next level!

::: details
Do you know about the PRPL Pattern?

It’s THE pattern to follow when you want good performances with your Web App, using cutting edge, modern web capabilities like HTTP/2, preload, service workers and ES modules.

Maybe you have heard about it, through a conference or talks post. Maybe it sounded really cool, but when it comes to reality, well... it looked pretty complicated…

I have good news for you: it’s not! Using the right tools; like PRPL-Server for example, it couldn't be easier.

How about a demonstration, a step by step tutorial, along with an in-depth presentation? Let’s go then!
