# Materials

This section collects in sparse order various elements (code samples, illustrations, etc.) that may or may not be used for other contents.

They are not intended to provide you with sufficient information without the help of these more structured and complete materials.

> You can also check out the [Code Samples](/code-samples/) section, which better contextualise most of the code samples.

::: warning
This section is under construction and is anticipated to remain that way for several months.

Most titles and some elements aren't translated from french to english.\
Refer to the [french version](/fr/materials/) for more up to date content.
