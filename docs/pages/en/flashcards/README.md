# Flashcards

A long time ago, I took the habit to write
[flashcards](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flashcard) every time I prepare some
new learning material. But I used to do it the old way, on paper. Because I then
used them to define a learning path visually.

So, of course, I never shared those online. And I want to change that! But I
didn't found any satisfying solution yet. So here, I'm giving a try to markdown,
to begin with.

I hope someday to find time to create something more useful and interesting
for you with those. Maybe with some
[Leitner System](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leitner_system)
and links with my learning materials. We'll see.
