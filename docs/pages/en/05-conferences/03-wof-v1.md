# Web on FIRE - v1

**The Web is on FIRE!**

> The F.I.R.E. safety kit for everyone!\
> Learn the best new capabilities of the modern web in one shot without burning out!

## Abstract

Four years ago the idea of Progressive Web Apps arrived in the world. This brought a whole new approach to mobile & web apps development, often summarized as F.I.R.E. (Fast Integrated Reliable & Engaging). But the web platform is constantly evolving and mutating, so how has F.I.R.E. technology evolved with it?

Join me to explore four cutting-edge technologies (one for each F.I.R.E. concept) that will help bring your web apps to the next level!

### Abstract

**It's time to join these fantastic four!**

> The Web Performance pattern you should already know!

Do you know about the PRPL Pattern?

It’s THE pattern to follow when you want good performances with your Web App, using cutting edge, modern web capabilities like HTTP/2, preload, service workers and ES modules.

Maybe you have heard about it, through a conference or talks post. Maybe it sounded really cool, but when it comes to reality, well... it looked pretty complicated…

I have good news for you: it’s not! Using the right tools; like PRPL-Server for example, it couldn't be easier.

How about a demonstration, a step by step tutorial, along with an in-depth presentation? Let’s go then!
