# Conferences & Events

An important part of FullWeb.dev is built on previous talks, bootcamps and codelabs.

First, the ["Web On FIRE" Show](/05-conferences/03-wof-v1) was created in the beginning of 2019. It presented 4 important innovations of the Web Platfom, and, among other things, gave birth to a 3 hours long conference at Breizhcamp.

Then, more work on ["Vanilla Web"](/05-conferences/02-vanilla-web) completed this original idea, leading to some other conferences,

Finally, a [second version of the "WoF Show"](/05-conferences/01-wof-v2) was created in the end of 2019 to show the most important orientations the Web Standards was adopting.

Of course, their will be some [other conferences](/05-conferences/futur/) after that, as soon as the end of the pandemic will allow technical events to occur again.
