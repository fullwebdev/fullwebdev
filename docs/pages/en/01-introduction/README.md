# Introduction

## What you'll find here

We just started this project, so this website is mostly inclomplete for now.

First, we're focusing on the [fundamentals](/02-fundamentals/) section, in 3 steps:

1. writing a lot of contents, in French (sorry for that)
2. finalizing, delivering and using this French version
3. creating and publish shorter contents based on parts of what we previously created, both in French and in english (houray!), step by step

Step 2 should end by the end of this year (2020), and we can't share a lot in the meantime.

Yet, we also create a lot of open-source stuff doing so.

First, most instruction materials (e.g. code samples and illustrations) are continuously delivered in the [Instruction Materials](/02-fundamentals/02-fundamentals/02-materials/) section.

We also maintain an [inventory](/03-inventory/) of every project we study, use and talk about (mostly libraries and dev tools). Any external contribution can help us, so please do not hesitate to send us a pull request.

We are also creating a bunch of dev tools during this process, and should be presented them here pretty soon.

Finally, you can already study our [codelabs](/04-codelabs/) and the videos of our [conferences](/05-conferences/). Those are 100% publicly available and all the related materials are open sourced on GitHub.
