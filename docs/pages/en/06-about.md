# About this project

The FullWeb.dev project was started in February 2020 in France by [Noël Macé](https://twitter.com/noel_mace){target="\_blank"} as a replacement/evolution of his previous related project, the [Web On FIRE Show](https://github.com/noelmace/web-on-fire){target="\_blank"}.

_And now, time to drop the royal we..._

A lot of people are helping me in this process, even if they don't directly contribute to the codebase in the related repository nor this website content. Therefor, this project is a collective effort, and I would consider it deloyal to them to make you think I'm doing everything on my own by using the first person.
