# About

This website and the associated contents are currently under development.

I'm putting intensive efforts into the development of this new contents. Before their completion, I can only deliver some very small parts of them publicly. This is why this website itself will stay pretty much as is for a few months. In the meantime, you'll find some of my open-sourced materials in the [material](/material/) section. However, these are delivered with no context. They are therefore mainly intended to be used with my direct assistance as part of my job.

If you want to be informed of the latest evolutions, subscribe to (i.e. "watch") this project's releases [on GitHub](https://github.com/fullwebdev/fullwebdev) and [follow me on Twitter](https://twitter.com/noel_mace). Contributions are very welcomed too, so do not hesitate to [open an issue](https://github.com/fullwebdev/fullwebdev/issues/new) and to fork this repository and send a Pull-Request.

Right now, you can also check out the list of my [conferences and workshops](/conferences/). Those are 100% publicly available and all the related materials are open sourced on GitHub.

Finally, I maintain a small and simple list on my other projects and platforms where you can find me on my personal Web page, [noelmace.com](https://noelmace.com).
