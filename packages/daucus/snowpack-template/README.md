## Available Scripts

### npm start

Runs the app in the development mode.
Open <http://localhost:8080> to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### npm run build

Builds the app for production to the `dist/` folder.
It correctly bundles lit-element in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

## Directives

In case you need to add a directive like `classMap` you should add the extension to the import:

```js
import { classMap } from 'lit-html/directives/class-map.js';
```
