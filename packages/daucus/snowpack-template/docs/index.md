## And more

This template project is minimalistic on purpose, such as Daucus.

To get more help on Daucus and Web Developement in general, go check out [fullweb.dev](https://fullweb.dev).

Fullweb.dev itself uses Daucus, lit-element & Snowpack under the hood, and can be a good example of a more advanced usage of these tools.
See our [monorepo](https://github.com/fullwebdev/fullwebdev) for more details.
