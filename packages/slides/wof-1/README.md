## :warning: DEPRECATION WARNING

I stopped updating the content of these slides the 7th of June 2019, as they were replaced by the "Season 2" (:octocat: [/packages/slides/wof-2](/packages/slides/wof-2)).

After that, this project has been moved from wof.show (:octocat: [noelmace/wof-reveal](https://github.com/noelmace/wof-reveal)) to (:octocat: [fullwebdev/fullwebdev](https://github.com/fullwebdev/fullwebdev)).

Go check the associated [monorepo](https://github.com/fullwebdev/fullwebdev) for more information.
