# Conferences & Events

An important part of FullWeb.dev is built on previous talks, bootcamps and codelabs.

First, the ["Web On FIRE" Show](/conferences/wof) was created in the beginning of 2019. It presented 4 important innovations of the Web Platfom, and, among other things, gave birth to a 3 hours long conference at Breizhcamp.

Then, more work on ["Vanilla Web"](/conferences/vanilla-web) completed this original idea, leading to some other conferences,

Finally, a [second version of the "WoF Show"](/conferences/wof) was created in the end of 2019 to show the most important orientations the Web Standards was adopting.
