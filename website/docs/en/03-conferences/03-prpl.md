# PRPL

## Abstract

**It's time to join these fantastic four!**

Do you know about the PRPL Pattern?

It’s THE pattern to follow when you want good performances with your Web App, using cutting edge, modern web capabilities like HTTP/2, preload, service workers and ES modules.

Maybe you have heard about it, through a conference or talks post. Maybe it sounded really cool, but when it comes to reality, well... it looked pretty complicated…

I have good news for you: it’s not! Using the right tools; like PRPL-Server for example, it couldn't be easier.

How about a demonstration, a step by step tutorial, along with an in-depth presentation? Let’s go then!
