# Conferences & Events

An important part of this project was built on previous talks, bootcamps and codelabs.

First, I created a series of conferences I called the ["Web On FIRE" Show](/conferences/wof) in the beginning of 2019. It presented four important innovations of the Web Platfom, and, among other things, gave birth to a 3 hours long conference at Breizhcamp.

Then, more work on ["Vanilla Web"](/conferences/vanilla-web) completed this original idea, leading to some other conferences,

Finally, a [second version of the "WoF Show"](/conferences/wof) was created in the end of 2019 to show the most important orientations the Web Standards was adopting.
