# Introduction

Nowadays, Web Development is becoming more and more specialized, and dogmatic.

_"Which framework should I learn first?" "Which one should I choose for my project?"_ Nobody has a clear answer to those questions. And yet, those are the ones we hear the most.

Developers are pushed to adopt one framework and to stick with it. To start learning web development with one of those, and then to become an "expert" on it. Even though people behind those frameworks are often working together, our community is torn apart by some trolls who never miss an opportunity to tell everyone how any other choice than theirs is wrong.

From this, it's tempting to reject them all. To hope the framework era is close to its end. And to do everything on our own, without any external tool.

We, at FullWeb.dev, think all these approaches can complete each other. That they don't contradict each other.

Opting, or not, for a framework or library, should only be based on context. This requires a full understanding of the consequences of this choice.

## What you'll find here

For now, the ["learn"](/learn) part of this website is mostly in french. It should remain so until the end of 2021.

Yet, I also created a lot of open-source libraries and tools doing so.
You'll find them in the ["build"](/build) section.
Of course, their documentation is & will be writen in english.
